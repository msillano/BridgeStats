For Bridge players: calculates scores and statistics

"Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought. 
The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. 
Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! 
It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose." 
  Sun Tzu, The art of war.

In Bridge, the choice of a good strategy often depends on the correct evaluation of cards in hand to your opponents.

This evaluation is done trying to make the best use of all available informations: bidding, played cards, etc ..., but an essential starting point is the knowledge of a priori probabilities of the possible distributions.

The 'Bridge Stats' app examines all possible distributions of the cards of one suit in the opponent hands and calculates  their  probabilities.
